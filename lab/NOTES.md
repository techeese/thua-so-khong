# lab/ — the vigil's workbench

Everything in this directory is **scratch**. Prototypes, probe harnesses, measurements, throwaway
HTML. `lab/*` is gitignored except this file.

**Nothing in here ships.** That is the rule that lets the loop work here without limit while the
game itself sits still. A prototype that looks worth shipping does not get shipped — it becomes a
candidate in `SYNTHESIS.md` / `MILESTONES.md` and waits for the owner to open an era for it.

Findings accumulate below, newest first, so the next synthesis has evidence instead of opinions.
Each entry: what was measured or built, the number or the observation, and which candidate era it
argues for or against.

## 2026-08-15 — 390px tap-reachability audit (`thumb390.py`, `zoneblame.py`)

Rasterised the real tap resolver (`index.html:1061-1097`) over the whole 960×600 logical plane at a
390px viewport, for 18 snapshots across all 16 seasons, and asked what a thumb can actually reach.
Geometry only — this measures the *reachable* half of the owner gate, not the *felt* half.

**Measured:**
- Canvas at 390px is **480.0 × 296.2 CSS px**, scale 2.000 logical-px per CSS-px. `hitR` resolves to
  44 logical px = **22.0 CSS px** exactly, i.e. the `max(34, 22*scale)` floor is doing its job and
  the slop does *not* degrade on a small screen.
- **ECLIPSE: 0.** Every villager, every season, holds a full undisturbed 1513 CSS px² tap disc
  (π·22²). Nobody is ever on-screen-but-unselectable. The "nearest wins" resolver was the suspected
  failure mode at small sizes; the cast is spread widely enough that it never bites. **Cleared.**
- **OCCLUSION: real, and it is the newest feature that pays.** The place-tap (hỏi thăm, shipped
  v0.26) only fires when *no* villager wins, and the villager whose home is a place is precisely the
  one standing on it. Pooled over all samples:
  | zone | taps stolen | by |
  |---|---|---|
  | market (`c`) | **20.7%** | Chị Hoa |
  | đình (`d`) | **14.0%** | Cô Mai |
  | river (`r`) | 1.0% | Cô Liên |
  Per-season peaks run to **27% of the market zone dead**, from season 3 onward. The figure drifts
  run to run (villagers wander): two runs gave 47 and 37 occluded zone-seasons.

**Reading it:** not a bug with a victim — a stolen tap selects that villager instead, and since
`S.looked[zone]` is only set on a *successful* place tap the player can retry. But the affordance
is quietly unreliable in exactly the wrong spot: aim at the stall, get Hoa's portrait. Roughly one
market tap in five misses, and the player has no way to know why. The irony is load-bearing —
*the villager who lives at the market is the one who hides the market.*

**Argues for:** a candidate era around **legibility of the place layer** — the places are currently
a hidden verb, competing with the cast for the same pixels and losing. Options worth prototyping if
the owner ever opens it: give zones priority when the tap lands inside the zone rectangle rather
than letting the villager pass win by proximity; or make the places visibly tappable at all.
**Argues against:** any "make tap targets bigger for phones" era — the slop floor already holds at
390px and eclipse is at zero. That worry is now retired with a number.

**Not shipped, per Gear 3.** `index.html` untouched. Harnesses live in `lab/` (gitignored).
